##Distributionally robust joint chance-constrained optimization for networked microgrids in sub- Saharan Africa
###### Energy and Power Group, University of Oxford Oct 2018 - April 2022
- The project is supported by the EPSRC project, Robust Extra low-cost solar nano-grid (RELCON).
- Created load profiles for rural energy-poor communities and solar power prediction model.
- Constructed a distributionally robust joint chance-constrained optimization (DR-JCC) framework for controlling networked microgrids considering solar generation uncertainty and utility contingencies
