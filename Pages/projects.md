**Risk-aware game framework for coordianting microgrids in the energy and reserve markets**

*Prof. Hobbs' group, Whiting School of Engineering, Johns Hopkins University (JHU)*		April 2022 â€“ October 2022

- Developed deep learning neural networks for the weather-informed probabilistic predictions of net loads.
- Evaluated different risk-aware formulations considering uncertain reserve service provisions from renewable microgrids. 
- Modeled players' strategic bidding and offerings in the power markets using the game-theoretical framework.
- The research has been submitted to journal and conference. 

**Distributionally robust joint chance-constrained optimization for networked microgrids**

*Energy and Power Group (Led by Prof. McCulloch) & Power Electronics Group (Led by Prof. Rogers), University of Oxford* 

- The project is supported by EPSRC project, Robust Extra low-cost solar nano-grid (RELCON), to develop microgrids for energy-poor communities.
- Modeled the power flow in the networked microgrids considering droop control and smart load shedding.
- Constructed a distributionally robust joint chance-constrained optimization framework for controlling networked microgrids considering solar generation uncertainty and utility contingencies.
- Developed an easy and fast solving method for the NP-hard optimal Bonferroni approximation.
- The research is published in IEEE Smart Grids and CDC conference. 

**Green Radio: Dynamic power saving configuration for mobile networks**

*The Alan Turing Institute, London*             							    Sep 2019

- The project collaborator is one of the world's largest mobile telecommunications companies, Telenor. 
- Forecasted day-ahead demands of 200 signal towers using five state-of-the-art ML algorithms.  
- Designed the activation policies for recommending day-ahead power-saving schemes.
- Clustered sectors of signal towers for improving scalability and summarized implications of reinforcement learning (RL) in future works. 
- The research is published as a co-authored report on the Turing website page.
