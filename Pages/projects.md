**Game-theoretical market framework for networked microgrids leveraging probabilistic net-load forecasting**

* Prof. Hobbs' group, Whiting School of Engineering, John Hopkins University (JHU)*		April 2022 â€“ October 2022

- Develop deep learning neural networks for the weather-informed probabilistic predictions of net loads.
- Evaluate different risk-aware formulations considering uncertain reserve service provisions from renewable microgrids. 
- Model players' strategic bidding and offerings in the power markets using the game-theoretical framework.


**Distributionally robust joint chance-constrained optimization for networked microgrids**

*Energy and Power Group, University of Oxford* 

- The project is supported by the EPSRC project, Robust Extra low-cost solar nano-grid (RELCON).
- Created load profiles for rural energy-poor communities and solar power prediction model.
- Constructed a distributionally robust joint chance-constrained optimization (DR-JCC) framework for controlling networked microgrids considering solar generation uncertainty and utility contingencies

**Green Radio: Dynamic power saving configuration for mobile networks**

*The Alan Turing Institute, London*             							    Sep 2019

- The project collaborator is one of the world's largest mobile telecommunications companies, Telenor. 
- Forecasted day-ahead demands of 200 signal towers using five state-of-the-art ML algorithms.  
- Designed the activation policies for recommending day-ahead power-saving schemes.
- Clustered sectors of signal towers for improving scalability and summarized implications of reinforcement learning (RL) in future works. 
- The research outcome has been published as a co-authored official report on the Turing website page.
