## Updates

[2023.01]  I started the post-doctoral research associate at MIT energy initiative!

[2022.12] This website says 'Hello World'.

[2022.12] I completed my DPhil degree in Oxford with minor correction!

## Research interests

The reliability of the power system under the impact of increasing renewable penetration and extreme weather conditions is a rising concern globally. My research interests include machine learning probabilistic forecasting, data-driven control and optimisation for energy systems considering uncertainty. My works aim to find appealing solutions in both system design and short-term operations. I have specific research interests in:

+Machine learning probabilistic forecasting
+Chance-constrained optimization
+Optimal power flow analysis
+Microgrid design and control under extreme conditions
