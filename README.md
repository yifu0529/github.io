I am a post-doctoral research associate at MIT Energy Initiative, and I have been fortunate to be supervised and funded by [Professor Thomas Magnanti](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/thomas-magnanti) 


## Research interests

The reliability of power systems under the impact of increasing renewable penetration and extreme weather conditions is a rising concern globally. My research interests include machine learning probabilistic forecasting, data-driven control and optimisation for energy systems considering uncertainty. My works aim to find appealing solutions in both system design and short-term operations. I have specific research interests in:

- Machine learning probabilistic forecasting.

- Joint chance-constrained optimization.

- Distributionally robust modelling.

- Optimal power flow analysis.

- Microgrid design and control under extreme conditions.
