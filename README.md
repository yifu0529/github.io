[2023.01] I joined C3E Woman in Energy at MIT.

## Research interests

The reliability of power systems under the impact of increasing renewable penetration and extreme weather conditions is a rising concern globally. My research interests include machine learning probabilistic forecasting, data-driven control and optimisation for energy systems considering uncertainty. My works aim to find appealing solutions in both system design and short-term operations. I have specific research interests in:

- Machine learning probabilistic forecasting.

- Joint chance-constrained optimization.

- Distributionally robust modelling.

- Optimal power flow analysis.

- Microgrid design and control under extreme conditions.
