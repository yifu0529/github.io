## Updates

[2023.01]  I started the post-doctoral research associate at MIT energy initiative!

[2022.12] This website says 'Hello World'.

[2022.12] I completed my DPhil degree in Oxford with minor correction!

## Research interests

The reliability of power systems under the impact of increasing renewable penetration and extreme weather conditions is a rising concern globally. My research interests include machine learning probabilistic forecasting, data-driven control and optimisation for energy systems considering uncertainty. My works aim to find appealing solutions in both system design and short-term operations. I have specific research interests in:

- Machine learning probabilistic forecasting.

- Joint chance-constrained optimization.

- Distributionally robust modelling.

- Optimal power flow analysis.

- Microgrid design and control under extreme conditions.

## Science talks &#128075

My friend and I started and run the engineering society at Wolfson College, Oxford Univerisity, with more than 100 members. We seek for and host speakers in Science & Engineering, particular in machine learning applications, open-source data and tools. If you are interested in giving a talk, please contact me or the president Dr. Ping Lu (ping.lu@eng.ox.ac.uk).
